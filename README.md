Project 5 on the Openclassroom Web Developer Course. ORINOCO

The main goals of this project was to be able to call an API using the different options available aswell as coding an entire website while using Javascript.

I used the courses provided by OC aswell as a lot of extern sources to thouroghly study Javascript and how to create a full functioning website with the language.
